backpack
========

identity is a payload

## outline

**backpack** is a tool for helping users understand the identity information
they're presenting (and leaking) all over the internet. It provides
understandable traffic introspection through readable reports and helpful
alerts.

## motive

According to Pew Research,
[users are struggling](http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/11/12/most-would-like-to-do-more-to-protect-their-personal-information-online/)
to get a handle on what they can keep private, and how to do it. We all are.

We don't have a good grip on what identities we're carrying with us when we go
from server to server, cloud to cloud, CDN to CDN. Between single sign-on,
supercookies, writing analysis, deep packet inspection, and metadata tracking,
it's hard to understand how identities are created, assigned, and tracked
through the internet.

**backpack** aims to change this.

## key concepts

### models

There are a few user-friendly tools that provide individual users a narrow
window into online identity tracking. [Ghostery](https://www.ghostery.com/) and
[Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) look at cookies, beacons,
and known tracking domains, providing a snap report at every
page. [AdBlock](https://adblockplus.org/) and [NoScript](http://noscript.net/)
work from domain-level blacklists, without analyzing specific content (how do
you tell the 'good' javascript from the 'bad'?).

What makes **backpack** different is **models**. Every report and traffic alert
relies on a specific model for analyzing local communications. Models can do
anything with the local traffic stream, as long as they're useful. Whether it's
watching for unencrypted torrent streams or warning on mixed Tor and non-Tor
traffic, models define behaviors that result in loss of identity.

When a model's conditions are met, the traffic of interest is stored,
summarized, and presented in an alert.

## technical

**backpack** is still very much developer only.

### backend ###

Here's a short list of the major components, from back to front.

#### node_pcap ####

We rely on [node_pcap](https://github.com/mranney/node_pcap) for capturing and
parsing network traffic. This is wrapped in the backend **Parser**.

#### MongoDB ####

After parsing, the data is inserted into a MongoDB collection `netdata` as a
document containing fields of interest. This data is made available to model
threads by publishing through `mubsub`. **Modeler** subscribes to `netdata` and
sends that data on to models (the only one that is in spec is the POC model at
the moment).

When a model's tests pass, an alert object is returned, and inserted into an
alert database, which is read by the frontend.

### frontend ###

#### Meteor+frontend HTML ####

A Meteor process watches the alert database for changes, updating an HTML page
feed with a low-intensity alert card. The user can acknowledge and snooze the
alert (UI only for now), or mark it for followup. A click expands the card with
further information and info link on how to seal the leak alerted.
